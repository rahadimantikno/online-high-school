It include uploading some documents for verification purposes such as but not limited to : recent photograph, certificate of birth, identification card/passport.

Aftar registered, the applicants habe their own secure page or dashboard for doing their activities. Such as setting up a profile, following course materials,administrasions,fees, comunities, helpdesk, etc. And also have their progress bar that start from registration process, enrolling studies up until completion of studies each semester.

After completion series of studies -- as per curriculum approved by local nation/authority -- the students will undergo a final test and/or examination -- approved by nation/authority, and if He/She pass, He/She can obtain High School Diploma Certificate
